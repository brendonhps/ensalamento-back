## Getting Started

 git clone https://github.com/brendonhps/ensalamento-back.git
 cd ensalamento-back
 npm i 
 node server/server.js
 ```


## Prerequisite: install Node.js

If you haven't already installed Node, [download and install Node.js](http://nodejs.org/en/download).  For best results, use the latest LTS (long-term support) release of Node.js.

## Install LoopBack tools

Although in theory, you could code a LoopBack
application from scratch, installing a LoopBack CLI tool makes it much easier to get
started.  It will scaffold an application that you can then customize to suit
your needs.  For more information, see [Command-line tools](Command-line-tools.html).

You have two options for LoopBack tools:

- **[LoopBack CLI tool](#install-loopback-cli-tool)**
- **[IBM API Connect v5 developer toolkit](#install-ibm-api-connect-developer-toolkit)**

You can also use the legacy StrongLoop CLI tool `slc`.
